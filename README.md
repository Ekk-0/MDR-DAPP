To Experience the system please connect to this network

* Network Name: Polygon Amoy Testnet
* New RPC URL: https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/
* Chain ID: 80002
* Currency Symbol: MATIC
* Block Explorer URL: https://amoy.polygonscan.com/
* Faucet: https://faucet.polygon.technology/

After that go to the Faucet link and fill your account with some MATIC, you will need it to be able to Receive Medium Rare Tokens (MRT).

Then go to http://64.227.176.240/ to view the website. Click on Request MRT to receive 10 MRT to your current selected MetaMask Account. Then you will be able to enter a amount you want to stake, and wait a few seconds and unstake the amount and you will see that you have gained some interest.

There are also 4 Boxes about the input form.
* One show the total MRT you have to stake.
* Second one shows the current total MRT that is being staked.
* Third one shows how much interest your account has gained over its lifetime.
* Last one shows your available + staked total.
